					<h6>Passion for home</h6>
					<h6>A History of living</h6>
					<p>
						My name is Katie. I'm a bit Southern, North-Eastern and South-Western. I don’t think a day goes by that I am not creatively invested in home design.
						My home design incorporates passion, love, energy, color, and excitement. Something about creating space; to spend time, come and go from, exist in, is my hearts desire. I have worked many years in different parts of the country. I am inspired by homes that are lived in as well beautiful. Our surroundings are meant to be a reflection of the things we care about. The people we care about sharing memories with. It’s not about being in or out of style. It’s about living life in a home you love.
						I want to serve as the light you need to get there.
